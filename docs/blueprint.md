## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Blue (#7DF9FF) to convey innovation and sophistication against the dark background.
- Background color: Near-black (#121214), creating a deep canvas that enhances contrast and minimizes eye strain in dark environments.
- Accent color: Neon Green (#39FF14) to highlight key interactive elements and important information, providing high visibility.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a techy feel; body text: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for longer readability. Code Font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace).
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use minimalist icons with hover effects, in neon green, to guide the user through the interface.
- Subtle, responsive micro-interactions (e.g., button presses, content transitions) to enhance user engagement without overwhelming the minimalistic aesthetic.
